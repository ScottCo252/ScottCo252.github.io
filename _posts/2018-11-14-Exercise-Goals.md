I'm back to using the treadmill this week after months of recovery. I'm going to post pictures, stats and notes from each workout to
track my progress. The first goal is to get back to my best level from a few years ago and the second will be to surpass it.  

Workout: Running intervals of 1 min fast, 2 min slow for at least 6 reps.  

**11/14/18**   
REPS:     5.5 MPH/4 MPH x 5 and 5 MPH/3 MPH x 1  
Distance: 1.41 Mi  
Time:     20:01  
Average:  4.23MPH
