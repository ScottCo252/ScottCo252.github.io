title: ESC Setting Data

I "discovered" a better setting for my RC race plane's ESC. I'll be going over the data that was pulled off the ESC and comparing it to
data from a race plane in 2017.

A litte background, I've race EF-1 class RC airplanes for the past 4 years. This past week, while building my fith Proud Bird, I noticed
castle ESC had a motor timing option labeled 'Custom'. When selecting it, it allowed input of a number from 1-20. This was much higher than
the default 'High' Setting of 10 that I typically use on my planes. I do not know what each unit signifies, but the discription of the setting explained that it controls the
power of the motor and will result in higher operating temperatures at higher settings. So I set it to 20 and take the new plane out to the
field yesterday.

Four test flights in and I can say it definitley felt faster and on the fourth flight, where I was really pushing it, I hit a low voltage alarm.
This is abnormal for my typical practice flights, so I had to pull the data and see what happened.

I'll be comparing the data from yesterday with data I pulled off a proud bird in 2017. It will be using the exact same configuration, castle speed
controller, Rimfire motor and Nantech battery(2.7 A, 4 cell). The only difference will be in the ESC motor timing setting and time of the year (December vs. March).
